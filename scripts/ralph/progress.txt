## Codebase Patterns
- Migrations use SQL files in supabase/migrations/ with YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_ prefix
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for CREATE TABLE/INDEX statements
- Enable RLS on new tables and add appropriate policies
- Build passes even with pre-existing lint errors in test files

- Implemented rubrics and rubric_criteria tables migration
- Files changed: supabase/migrations/20260111092739_create_rubrics_tables.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase migrations use plain SQL files with timestamp prefixes
  - Teachers table is referenced as `teachers(id)` for foreign keys
  - RLS policies need to be enabled and configured for each table
  - Use CASCADE on foreign keys for criteria -> rubric relationship
  - Column named "order" needs quotes because it's a reserved keyword
