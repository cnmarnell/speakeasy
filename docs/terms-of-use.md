# Speakeasy — Terms of Use

**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

## 1. Agreement

By creating an account or using Speakeasy ("the Platform"), you agree to these Terms of Use. If you don't agree, don't use the Platform.

## 2. What Speakeasy Is

Speakeasy is an AI-powered learning tool that helps university students practice and improve soft skills, public speaking, and presentation delivery. The Platform provides automated feedback using artificial intelligence — it is **not** a replacement for human instruction, professional evaluation, or academic judgment.

## 3. Account Responsibilities

- You must use a valid university email to register.
- You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure.
- You may not share your account with others or access another user's account.
- You must provide accurate information when creating your account.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree to use Speakeasy only for its intended educational purposes. You may **not**:

- Upload content that is offensive, threatening, or unrelated to coursework
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, hack, or disrupt the Platform
- Use the Platform to harass or harm other users
- Scrape, copy, or redistribute Platform content or AI-generated feedback
- Use automated tools (bots, scrapers) to interact with the Platform

## 5. AI-Generated Feedback Disclaimer

Speakeasy uses AI models to analyze your presentations and generate feedback, scores, and suggestions. **This feedback is automated and has limitations.**

- AI feedback is a learning aid, not a definitive professional or academic evaluation.
- Scores and suggestions may contain errors or miss nuances a human evaluator would catch.
- Final grading decisions in your courses remain with your instructor — not Speakeasy's AI.
- We continuously work to improve our AI, but we do not guarantee accuracy or completeness.

**Use AI feedback as one input in your learning process, not the only one.**

## 6. Intellectual Property

- **Your content:** You retain ownership of the recordings, presentations, and other content you upload. By using the Platform, you grant Speakeasy a limited license to process this content solely to provide the service (transcription, AI analysis, feedback).
- **Our content:** The Platform itself — including its design, AI models, branding, and generated feedback text — is the intellectual property of Speakeasy. You may not copy, distribute, or create derivative works from it.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Speakeasy is provided **"as is"** during this pilot period. To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service.
- We are not liable for any academic outcomes based on AI-generated feedback.
- Our total liability to you for any claim arising from your use of the Platform is limited to the amount you paid to use it (which, during the pilot, is $0).
- We are not responsible for damages resulting from unauthorized access to your account if caused by your failure to protect your credentials.

## 8. Termination

- **By you:** You can stop using Speakeasy at any time. Contact us to request account deletion.
- **By us:** We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, abuse the Platform, or if we discontinue the service.
- Upon termination, your data will be handled according to our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

## 9. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We'll notify you of material changes via email or in-app notice. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to conflict of law principles.
